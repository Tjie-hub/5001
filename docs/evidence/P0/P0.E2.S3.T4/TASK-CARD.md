# Task Card — P0.E2.S3.T4

**Trace tag:** [L-4]
**Story:** P0.E2.S3 — Small severities worth the baseline
**Status:** not-started

## Intent
Log a note when a holiday check fails open, instead of failing silently.

(Source: PLAN-001 §3, Phase 0 — Audit Triage.)

## Evidence list (EXEC-001 §3.2 — check off what applies as produced)
- [ ] Test output (named-test run log)
- [ ] Regression run (full-suite output; audit-finding regression tests called out)
- [ ] Gate-script output (scripts/pre_merge_gate.py)
- [ ] Documentation delta (if operator-facing or contract-changing)
- [ ] Decision entries (IDs, if any §8-classifiable event occurred)

## Rollback lever
git revert of the squash commit on main (EXEC-001 §12, commit/task layer) — every P0 change is an isolated trivial fix per PLAN-001 §3 Phase 0 preamble.
